### Streamcluster
Stream Cluster (SC) solves a clustering problem.
For a stream of input points, it finds a pre-determined number
of medians so that each point is assigned to its nearest center.

The problem size can be set by passing a command line argument. If not specified it is set to 65536 floats.
