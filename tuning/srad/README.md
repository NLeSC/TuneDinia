## Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion (SRAD) Benchmark
SRAD is a diffusion algorithm based on partial differential equations and used for removing the speckles in an image without sacrificing
important image features.

The size of the input can be set as a command line argument for both kernels. If not specified then it is set to 4096x4096.
